Hi, I'm **Yu Zeng** (曾昱). I’m a biomechanist and evolutionary biologist based in the University of South Florida at Tampa, Florida.

### Research
I mostly work on the biomechanics, architecture and evolution of smart designs in organisms. The majority of my work involves appendicular systems used for locomotion in air, feeding and predator-prey interactions, from cellular to organismal levels. 

### Contact
You can send me emails at: yuzeng {at} usf {dot} edu / dreavoniz {at} berkeley {dot} edu / zeng {at} berkeley {dot} edu / (yzeng7 {at} ucmerced is no longer working)

### Education
I received my Ph.D. in Integrative Biology, University of California at Berkeley, and I was co-advised by [Robert Dudley](https://berkeleyflightlab.org) & [David Wake](https://wakelab.berkeley.edu/).
