Hi, I'm **Yu Zeng** 曾昱. I’m a biologist based in the University of South Florida at Tampa, Florida.

### Research
Biomechanics, architecture and evolution of organismal designs. 

My research investigates how the interplay between physical laws and organisms generates the vast diversity of organismal designs, such as flapping wings, legs and other appendicular systems used for flying, maneuvering and feeding in air, on land or at the liquid-air interfaces. 

Main themes: 
* Evolution and biomechancis of flight in insects, which also involves aerial maneuvers and gliding without wings. The model systems include stick insects (Phasmatodea) and other arthropods. 
* Mechanisms of appendage-mediated rapid performances, especially in feeding and predator-prey interactions.
